               <h3>cake & foods</h3>
               <p>For hundreds of years, there has been a link between hospitality and food. This can be dated all the way back to biblical times when people would open their homes to others and break bread as a sign of friendship and a warm welcome. It does not necessarily make this a religious practice, but more of one that has been followed for years because of its effectiveness. Offering delicious food gives off a great first impression during any circumstance and allows for a creatively shared space that invokes discussion and ultimate decision making. </p>

       <p>Music activates the memory, reward, and pleasure centers in the brain. This helps establish positive memories of the event, and even improves the absorption of critical take-aways. Whether it's a festival, concert or celebratory party, music unites people, bringing them together to enjoy dancing and to be entertained. It breaks down social barriers by encouraging people to mingle as well as language barriers. Everyone can enjoy a popular rhythm or beat without the need for words</p>
